TX Column
=========

This is the rightmost column in the MAP that shows up when there are upcoming
broadcasts for a brand, or when there was a broadcast in the last 18 months. 

## Programme Image
The image for a programme won't be shown if it's the same image as the context programme (the brand). It also won't be
shown if the Tx column is in a mini map.

## Radio and TV Differences
* Trailing links for upcoming broadcasts in radio brand pages split the upcoming broadcasts count into debuts and repeats
* Radio brand pages don't show 'New' or 'New Series' badges
