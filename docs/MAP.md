Media Availability Panel
============

This panel is shown on the TLEC Pages.  
The map either has to have episodes or a coming soon promotion in order to be displayed.

## Column Layout

The MAP has a main programme info column on the left hand side. In most cases this takes up the left 1/2 of the map.
The bottom of the right hand side has a bar with a list of links to social media (if social info is available). Above this bar are either 1 or 2 other columns taking up the rest of the MAP.

If the TLEC is World News, has a coming soon promo, had a broadcast within the last 18 months or has upcoming broadcasts, the MAP will display "three columns".
Otherwise is will just display "two".

### "Two" column layout
The MAP will display the Programme Info in the left hand column taking up 2/3rds of the MAP. The other 1/3rd of the MAP will display the On-Demand Column.
If the Social Bar exists, it will sit below the On-Demand column.

### "Three" column layout
The MAP will display the Programme Info in the left hand column taking up 1/2 of the MAP. The other 1/2 of the MAP will display 2 other Columns.  
If the page is a World News page, the middle column will be the Last On column, otherwise it will be the On Demand column.  
If the page has a coming soon promo, the right hand column will be the Coming Soon column, otherwise it will be the Transmission (Tx) column.  
If the Social Bar exists, it will sit below the two right hand columns.

### Mini Map
The Mini Map is the MAP being displayed without images. This can be set at a TLEC level or forced via a URL param (?__2016minimap=1).  
Because the programme info column is mainly an image, it makes no sense for it to take up 1/2 the map if the MAP is not displaying images. And so when in the Mini Map layout, the Programme Info column only takes up 1/3rd of the MAP with the other two columns also each taking up 1/3rd.  
The "two" column layout column sizes are not affected by the Mini Map.
