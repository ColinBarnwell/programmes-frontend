On-Demand Column
=========

In a two-column map, this is the rightmost column, otherwise it is in the centre column.
This column is replaced by the Last On column if the TLEC belongs to BBC World News.  
It displays the most recent streamable episode.

## Logic
If there are no streamable episode nor any upcoming: A "not available" message is displayed  
If the programme has only just been broadcast and will be streamable, but isn't yet: The upcoming episode is displayed with a badge saying it will be available soon  
If there is a streamable episode: That episode is displayed  
Else: An "available shortly" message is displayed

## Programme Image
The image for a programme won't be shown if the On Demand column is in a mini map.

## Radio and TV Differences
* Some strings have small differences depending on if the TLEC is TV or Radio
* Radio brand pages don't show 'New' or 'New Series' badges
