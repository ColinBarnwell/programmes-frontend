What's a day in the schedules page?
===================================

One of the many peculiarities of /programmes is that what a day constitutes varies depending on the outlet.

For TV, a Broadcast Day is 24 hours long, starting at 6am and running till
6am the next day. As the day starts at 6 am, The Broadcast Day for
2017-02-05T03:00:00 is 2017-02-04T06:00:00 till 2017-02-05T06:00:00.

For Radio, a Broadcast Day is 30 hours long, starting at midnight and running
till 6am the next day. A single point in time in the early morning will fit
into two "days" we resolve this by ignoring the first 6 hours. The day for
2017-02-05T03:00:00 is 2017-02-05T00:00:00 till 2017-02-06T06:00:00;
NOT 2017-02-04T00:00:00 till 2017-02-05T06:00:00.
