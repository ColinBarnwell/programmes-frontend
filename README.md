### Static Assets
Using Yarn allows the dependencies to be properly locked, and can abstract away
the need to install other packages globally.
[Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) first.

Then perform `yarn install`

To perform the development tasks
`yarn run dev`

To perform the dist tasks (for ci)
`yarn run dist`

To watch for file changes
`yarn run watch`
